                 as well adding your own system call to the kernel.

                    Your going to need a few things set up do accomplish this task.

                <h3>Download Ubuntu ISO</h3>
                <p>Download Ubuntu Desktop 13.10. You can find it <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop">here</a>.</p>
                
                <h3>Install Virtual Box</h3>
                <p>
                    You are going to need to set up a virtual machine. This is probably not something you want to be 
                    doing on your personal machine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Virtual box is a great open source software, with plenty of support, for creating virtual machines. You can download it and
                    find instructions for installing it <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">here</a>. Your are going 
                    too need that ISO you just downloaded to install Ubuntu 13.10 on your virtual machine.If you need
                    further instructions they should be easy to find on the web, but here are some tips to save you
                    time and frustration.

                    <p>
                        Make sure you have Intel Virtualization Technology, or the equivalent if non Intel mother board, 
                        enabled in your BIOS. You can usually find it under advanced processor settings.

                    <h4>Tip</h4>
                    <p>
                        When you finish installing Ubuntu 3.10 on your virtual machine your might notice that the
                        display will be small and will not encompass the entire window. Virtual Box has an extention
                        to allow the display to adjust with the window size. Select insert guest additions in the window 
                        menu named <em>Devices</em>. This should do the trick.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Suggestion</h4>
                    <p>
                        Split your RAM and cores evenly between your virtual machine and your actual machine for best
                        performance.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h3>Get Kernel Source Code</h3>
                <p>
                    I am going to assume you can install git, safely I hope. You can clone the git repo with the following 
                    command <code>git clone git://kernel.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ubuntu-saucy.git</code>. This will take a
                    while. Do this in your virtual machine you will be working from there.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <div class="page-header">
                    <h1>Compiling the Kernel</h1>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Okay step my step right. So lets start by compiling the kernel as is to make sure everything works
                    before you mess with the code.
                </p>
                <h3>Get The Dependencies</h3>
                <p>
                    Compiling the kernel requires some dependencies, you can get them with this command 
                    <code>sudo apt-get build-dep linux-image-$(uname -r)</code>.
                </p>
                <h3>Compiling</h3>
                <p>
                    Now that we got everything we need, lets compile. From inside the root directory of the kernel
                    source type the following command <code>debian/rules clean</code>. When its done cleaning enter
                    <code>debian/rules binary-headers binary-generic</code>. This will take a while.
                </p>

                    <h4>Suggestion</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you want to speed up this process, power down your virtual machine and temporarily allocate
                        more cores and RAM to your virtual machine. Not too much though, your physical machine need 
                        resources too.
