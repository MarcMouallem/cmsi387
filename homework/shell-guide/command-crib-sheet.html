                Bash, standing for born again shell, is the Linux command line shell. Command line is the most powerful
                and efficient way to interface with applications.

                Unlike most application interfaces, the command line does not require the existence of multiple and 
                specific forms, buttons or any other interfacing widgets. Instead it provides a single text input that 
                can specify any command for any application that currently, or will ever, exist. This is what makes 
                command line so powerful.

                In addition, there is no scene of navigating the cursor in a terminal. For that reason the terminal is
                already ready to accept the users next command. This is what makes the command line so efficient.
