Dining Philosophers
===================

I am implementing the audience solution. Details can be found [here][1].

To Compile
----------
You must add a few flags, but here is the command.
``g++ -lpthread -std=c++11 start.cpp PhilosophicalSecession.cpp Philosopher.cpp``

> JD: You know a `Makefile` would have totally made this turnkey.

To Run
------
You must specify how many philosophers are at the table as an argument. Typically five.
``a.out 5``
